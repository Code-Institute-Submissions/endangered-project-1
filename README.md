  This project is a frontend-only website using technologies learned through my user-centric frontend development module. I chose not to follow the brief provided but instead to develop a website which aims to highlight animal species at risk of extinction. The website provides insight into the main threats to the lives of these endangered animals and information on the remaining populations. As well as documenting five of the most at-risk species globally, the website provides links to charitable organsisations which fight to prevent animal extinction. 
  
  UX:
  
  The ENDANGERED website I developed to raise awareness about species endangerment. It provides some information on different at-risk species globally and links to websites of animal protection agencies and charities for users interested in learning more or making a donation. Below are a few potential users:
  
  Patrick 47yrs: I am an animal lover and recently watched a documentary on rhino poaching. Im interested to learn about the threats to rhinos and other endangered animals and find information and how I might be able to help prevent further species population decline. I found the 'Save the Species' page particulary helpful with links to organisations which battle against animal eradication. 
  
  Sarah 13yrs: I was given a homework project to make a presentation on a topic that I feel strongly about and i chose animal extinction. Using the Endangered website, I was able to find out statistics on animal populaton decline and details about the main threats posed to these animals.

  FEATURES:
  
  Navigation bar - each page has a collapsible navbar which allows the user to easily naviagte the website. 
  
  Footer - each page has a footer which includes icons representing potential links to different media pages. As this website is strictly static, the icons are not acive links. 
  
  Homepage- the homepage is a striking gallery of colourful images of different animal species. It is designed to be eye catching and to draw attention to the text overlay which provides a short introduction to the website. 
  
  Most at Risk- this page documents five of the most at risk species globally, details on their population and threats to their existence. Each animal has a striking image with a light overlay hover effect which zooms in from the left side to reveal the species name and population. 
  
  Save the Species - This page uses bootstrap cards to display the logo of different animal protection organisations as well as a short intro to their work. Again the links to the websites do not work as this is a static website. Instead a modal informs the user that the link is under construction. 
  
  Contact Us- this page provides a gps location using google maps of the 'Endangered' organisation, set to the address of the ibat building temple bar. A form allows the user to either make a donation, report an issue with the website or enquire for further information. A contact phone number is also provided as well as social media links. 
  
  Features to implement:
  
  Ideally if this website were interactive, i would like to set up stripe payments to a charitable organisation. In addition I would activate the media links as well as the links to external websites. 
  
  I would also like to implement a data dashboard demonstratinhg the decline in different species over time using a line chart of time against population.
